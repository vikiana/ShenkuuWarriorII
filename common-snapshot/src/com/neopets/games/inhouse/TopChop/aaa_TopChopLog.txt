=====================
===== TO DO: ========
=====================
- make points appear after hit has happened
- fix chinese space issues (see email)
- adjust size of logo in other langs
- change sizes of elements in library after everything is approved (instead of setting them in code)
- maybe I don't need to pass x coordinate to Slider. seems to be set throughout game
- refine timer
- make sure timer is stopped and deactivated
- slider event listener is not removed when restarting the game a second time!
- reset mHasPowerUp
- call removePowerUp in Scoreboard whenever game ends
- find solution for when two power ups are displayed and both have event listener
  - idea: put in array and clear it
- determine center hit bonus with help of qa
- add sound
- load distractions according to background
- get rid of "time wasted" animation and just use disappointed?
- track and reset GameVars.mSenseiStatus
- reset boni


=====================
==== QUESTIONS: =====
=====================
- what's up with timer?
- should power ups be permanent for the stage or should they have a time limit (example super hasee bounce)?
- what should happen when timer up exactly? modify point reward? game over?
- let's start title exploration
- power up placing?
- should power up increase sweet spot or green zone?

=====================
==== ART NEEDED: ====
=====================
- appear animation for power ups
- buttons

=====================
===== DONE: =========
=====================
- reset cricket animation when end game is clicked
- rip instructions out of GameMenu
- black gi in stage 13
- award power ups for 3 center hits total, not just 3 in a row
- display stats in pop up screen
- detect if power up is already active and don't give that one as an option
- make last 3 stages be not unlockable
- make collision detection based on upper and lower edge of slider, safe zone and super safe zone
- start slider at random point on meter at level start
- award points based on distance between slider and super safe zone instead of meter center
- count times that super safe green zone was hit
- remove everything to do with test buttons and integrate functionality into game
- fix issue with sound and music button
- don't display continue button if user can choose between 2 power ups
  power up will function as continue button
- activate power up with mouse
- disable end game button between stages
- repeat same level when extra life, don't move on to next level

=====================
