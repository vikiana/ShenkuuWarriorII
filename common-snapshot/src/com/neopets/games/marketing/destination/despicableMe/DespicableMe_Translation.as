Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this home is a vast secret hideout.<br/>Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru (Steve Carell), planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way.<br/>Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo (Grace Rolek), Edith (Elsie Fisher) and Agnes (Dana Gaier).<br/>Jason Segel, Miranda Cosgrove, Russell Brand, Will Arnett, Kristen Wiig, Danny McBride and Carol Burnett (voicing Gru's mother) fill out the cast.</p></font>";

		// Image Gallery Page
		public var IDS_ABOUT_AGNES:String = "<font><p><b>AGNES – Elsie Fisher</b><br/>An innocent little girl who loves unconditionally and desperately wants to be loved, the youngest of the three orphans lives to hug.  Agnes is obsessed with unicorns and says random, sweet things.  She longs for nothing more than parents to make her family complete…and that unicorn wouldn’t hurt.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_TOURISTS:String = "<font><p><b>TOURIST DAD AND MOM –<br/>Jack McBrayer and Mindy Kaling</b><br/>The tackiest tourists you’ll encounter, this family is on vacation with their young son.  Armed with wild clothes, disposable cameras and bad fanny packs, the tourists are in for a more exciting trip than they could ever dream.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_EDITH:String = "<font><p><b>EDITH – Dana Gaier</b><br/>The kid who tests all limits, Edith is the last girl in the orphanage you would run to adopt.  Wearing a hat pulled down over her eyes, she is seen as a bit of a scoundrel.  Though this middle child needs (and wants) limits, she’ll never let you know it. </p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_FRED:String = "<font><p><b>FRED MCDADE – Danny McBride</b><br/>Gru’s nudge of a next-door neighbor, Fred McDade is, of course, the president of the homeowner’s association.  Quick to point out any minor infractions of the neighborhood code, McDade is a constant thorn in Gru’s side.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_GRU:String = "<font><p><b>GRU – Steve Carell</b><br/>Gru is a villain who finds great pleasure in doing deliciously wicked things to other people.  Whether it’s zapping an annoying telemarketer on the phone or freezing a long queue of customers in line ahead of him at a coffee shop, Gru gets to do all of the things we only wish we could.  Gru is on track to become the greatest villain of all time, but he’s about to face his toughest challenge yet: fatherhood.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_HATTIE:String = "<font><p><b>MISS HATTIE – Kristen Wiig</b><br/>Miss Hattie runs the local orphanage where Margo, Edith and Agnes live before they are sent to live with Gru.  A seemingly kind and concerned caretaker, Miss Hattie is actually a stern Southern belle who believes in tough love and big business. </p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_KYLE:String = "<font><p><b>KYLE</b><br/>A cross between a bulldog and a piranha with the attitude to match, Kyle is Gru’s guard dog.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_MARGO:String = "<font><p><b>MARGO – Miranda Cosgrove</b><br/>The oldest of the three orphans, Margo is naturally protective of her two sisters.  Raised without a family, she distrusts people and knows the only ones the girls can count on are each other.  Argumentative and a strong protector, Margo is not afraid to challenge Gru as he tries to parent the girls.  He has finally met his match. </p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_MINIONS:String = "<font><p><b>MINIONS – Jemaine Clement, Pierre Coffin</b><br/><br/>Small, yellow creatures, the Minions form Gru’s not-so-bright pit crew.  Hardworking and devoted to their leader and his mad exploits, the Minions are content to serve as his crash test dummies. </p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_MOM:String = "<font><p><b>GRU’S MOM – Julie Andrews</b><br/>Behind every great villain is a disapproving mom.  Nothing Gru has done has been good enough for his judgmental grump of a mother, Marlene.  While she believes she’s quite loving, Marlene still treats Gru like he’s 8 years old.  Her overly critical approach to parenting has made him the cunning villain he is today.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_NEFARIO:String = "<font><p><b>DR. NEFARIO – Russell Brand</b><br/>Gru’s resident mad scientist, Dr. Nefario is approximately 150 years old and vacillates between being brilliant and spacey.  Always hard at work building his boss the latest in incredible vehicles and weaponry, Nefario is (sometimes) sharp as a tack.  His hearing, however?  That began to fade at least 50 years ago.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_PERKINS:String = "<font><p><b>MR. PERKINS – Will Arnett</b><br/>The unforgiving loan manager who runs the Bank of Evil, Mr. Perkins funds Gru’s wicked plans.  A monster of a man who has grown unsatisfied with Gru’s imperfect track record, Perkins has reached the end of his financing rope.</p></font>";
		public var IDS_ABOUT_VECTOR:String = "<font><p><b>VECTOR – Jason Segel</b><br/>Gru’s nemesis, this nerdy villain is way too geeky to be so cocky.  Holed up in his sleek house/fortress, Vector can usually be found playing video games and plotting his next move.  His favorite weapon is a gun that fires live piranhas.  Unfortunately for him, Vector has a hard time keeping the carnivores inside the gun’s barrel... </p></font>";
